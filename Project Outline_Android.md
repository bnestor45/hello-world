# To-Do List App

## Project Description
This project is about building a to-do list app where users can create, mark as complete, and even delete tasks if necessary.  The app will store tasks on the phone, display them in a list, and allow users to edit tasks respectively.

## Problem Addressing
Everyone has daily tasks, but keeping track of them on paper or in your head isn’t the way to go. This app provides a way to organize tasks and boost productivity. It’s simple, lightweight, and will natively have an offline capability.

## Platform
Android  
Minimum SDK of Android 8.0

## Front/Back End Support
Frontend: XML for UI development & Activities/Fragments to control the screens  
Backend: Room for data manipulation; possibly LiveData depending on how the app evolves

## Functionality
Add a Task: User types a new task into a text box and saves it.  
View Tasks: Tasks appear in a scrollable list.  
Edit Task: User taps a task to update its text.  
Delete Task: Swipe left/right and confirm to delete a task.  
Mark Complete: Checkbox to mark a task as done.  
Tasks will remain if the app is closed and reopened.  
Again, depending on app evolution, additional functions may be added such as due dates and notifications
